# SentoArena (2016)

SentoArena is a personal 3D arena combat prototype inspired by games like Overwatch.
The project was developed in 2016 as an experimental playground for character
abilities, fast-paced movement, and multiplayer arena mechanics.

The prototype features character customization, multiple weapon types that change
abilities, and early implementations of spells, VFX, and flexible combat logic.

## Features

- **Fast-paced 3D arena combat**
- **Character customization** (models, outfits, blend shapes)
- **Multiple weapons** that dynamically change available abilities
- **Prototype ability system** (spells, projectiles, melee attacks)
- **Mobility mechanics** (jumping, dashing, movement on curved surfaces)
- **Early multiplayer support**
- **Handmade character models & animations** (Blender, MakeHuman)
- **Blendshape-based customizations**
- **High-speed arena traversal on spherical/curved geometry**

## Technology Stack

- **Unity (C#)**
- **Blender** – modeling, rigs, animations
- **MakeHuman** – base humanoid models
- **Photoshop & GIMP** – textures, UI, effects
- **Custom shaders & VFX** within Unity

## Purpose of the Project

SentoArena was created as a personal learning project to explore:

- Real-time combat system design  
- High-mobility gameplay and level traversal  
- Character art pipeline (modeling → rigging → animation → import)  
- Ability and weapon system architecture  
- Visual effects and gameplay feedback  
- Early networking experiments  

It served as a foundation for exploring complex gameplay systems and
experimenting with visual style, effects, and level design.

## Notes

This project is a prototype and not a full game.  
It was never intended for release, but rather for experimentation and learning.
